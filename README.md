Zynthian is a multi-engine platform and at the present time can run the next Synth Engines:

+ [ZynAddSubFX] (https://sourceforge.net/projects/zynaddsubfx/) (Advanced Synthesizer)
+ [FluidSynth] (http://www.fluidsynth.org/) (Sampler engine)
+ [setBfree] (https://github.com/pantherb/setBfree) (Hammond B3 emulation)
+ [Linuxsampler] (https://www.linuxsampler.org/) (Advanced Sampler engine)
+ [Carla] (http://kxstudio.linuxaudio.org/Applications:Carla) (Plugin Host)
+ [MOD-HOST + MOD-UI] (https://github.com/moddevices) (Plugin Host & Web GUI by [ModDevices] (http://moddevices.com))

The [Zynthian Distribution] (http://blog.zynthian.org/index.php/2015/11/22/building-a-zynthian-box/) includes a good amount of sound libraries and presets, but can be extended by the user.

A [Zynthian Box] (http://blog.zynthian.org/index.php/2015/11/22/building-a-zynthian-box/) is a hardware device that complains the [Zynthian Hardware Specificacion] (http://blog.zynthian.org/index.php/2015/11/22/building-a-zynthian-box/):

+ Raspberry Pi 2/3
+ HifiBerry DAC+ or other soundcard compatible with RBPi
+ PiTFT touchscreen or other screen compatible with RBPi
+ 4 rotary encoders + switches (zynthian controller modules)
+ GPIO expander (MCP23008) => you need it becasue the RBPi GPIOs are not enough
+ MIDI-IN using RBPi UART (optional)

This repository contains the specific software used by a Zynthian Box. It includes the "User Interface software" and some "setup scripts".

A standard Zynthian Box get updated from this repository by default, but can be configured to get updated from other repositories.

You can learn more about the Zynthian Project reading [the blog] (http://blog.zynthian.org) or visiting [the website] (http://zynthian.org). Also, you can join the conversation in [the forum] (https://discourse.zynthian.org).
