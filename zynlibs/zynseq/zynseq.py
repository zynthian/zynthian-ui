#	Most library functions are accessible directly by calling libseq.functionName(parameters)
#	Following function wrappers provide simple access for complex data types. Access with zynseq.function_name(parameters)
#
#	Include the following imports to access these two library objects:
# 		from zynlibs.zynseq import zynseq
#		from zynlibs.zynseq.zynseq import libseq
