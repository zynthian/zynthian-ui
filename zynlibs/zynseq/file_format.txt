zynseq file format (RIFF)
=========================
Version 6
Pattern time is measured in steps.
Sequence time is measured in MIDI clock cycles.

RIFF Header: (Version block must be first. If ommitted assume version 0.)
	Block ID: "vers"
	Block size: 32-bit big endian
Block:
	File format version [32]
    Tempo [2]
    Time signature (beats per bar) [2]
	MIDI channel for triggers and tallies [1]
	Trigger JACK input [1] (Not yet implemented)
	Trigger JACK output [1] (Not yet implemented)
	Padding [1]
	Vertical zoom [2]
	Horizontal zoom [2]

RIFF Header:
	Block ID: "patn"
	Block size: 32-bit big endian
Block:
	Pattern ID [4]
	Quantity of beats [4]
	Steps per beat [2]
	Map / scale [1] (Added in V1)
	Scale tonic [1] (Added in V1)
	Reference note [1] (May be used to remember location in pattern editor) (Added in V5)
	Padding [1] (Added in V5)
	Events: (quantity deduced from block length)
		Start step [4]
		Duration [4]
		Command [1]
		Value 1 start [1]
		Value 2 start [1]
		Value 1 end [1]
		Value 2 end [1]
		Unused padding [1] = 0

RIFF Header:
	Block ID: "bank"
	Block size: 32-bit big endian
Block:
	Bank ID [1]
    Padding [1]
    Quantity of sequences (grid size) [4]
    Sequences:
        Play mode [1]
        Group [1]
		Trigger note [1] (This seems like wrong place but makes code much simpler)
		Padding [1]
		Name [16] (Since V6)
        Quantity of tracks [4]
        Tracks:
            MIDI channel [1]
            JACK output [1]
            Keymap [1] (bits scale: 0..200, 254=map)
            Padding [1]
            Quantity of patterns [2]
            Patterns:
                Start time [4]
                Pattern ID [4]
        Quantity of timebase events [4]
        Timebase events:
            Event measure [2]
            Event tick [2]
            Event command [2] [0x0001: Tempo, 0x0002: Time signature]
            Event data [2] (maybe variable data in future?)

RIFF Header: (user defined scales) NOT IMPLEMENTED
	Block ID: 'scal'
	Block size: 32-bit big endian
Block:
	Scale index [1] (0..200)
	Quantity of notes in scale [1]
	Notes:
		Note offset [1]
	Pad if necessary [0/1]


**Patterns must be stored (or loaded) before sequences which rely on references to patterns**

Keymap File Format
==================
Keymaps are stored in JSON. There are two types:
Map:
{
	"type":"map", # Defines the type of the map (required: map | scale)
	"scale":[0,2,4,5,7,9,11], # Array of note offsets within scale (required for scale type: values: 0..11)
	"default":48, # Defines the default MIDI note to select after loading map (0..127 Default: 60)
	"keys":       # Array of keys in map (required for map type)
	[
		{
			"note":36,            # MIDI note number (required: 0..127)
			"name":"Kick Drum",   # Title to show on key (default: note+octave, e.g. C4)
			"colour":"#000000"}   # Background colour of key (default: white)
	]
}
